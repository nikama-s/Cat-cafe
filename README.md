**Cat Café Menu** is a React-based, front-end-only project that simulates the user experience of a cute café website.

## 🛠 **Features**

- **Browse Menu**: Users can easily navigate through the café's categories, selecting items to add to their order. The menu is replaced by other components when needed but can always be revisited.
  
- **About Us**: Clicking on the "About Us" paw icon replaces the menu with information about the café, giving users a peek into the café’s background and atmosphere.

- **Order**: When the "Order" paw icon is clicked, users are shown their current order, complete with a detailed list of items added, a field to select tip value, and a display showing the total bill.

## 🎨 **Design and User Experience**
The website's playful design is centered around a **pink color scheme**. Key navigation buttons are represented by paw icons, maintaining the cozy, cat-centric theme. A cat image is featured on the right side of the page, further enhancing the cute and fun aesthetic.
